# NER Model Exercises with spaCy

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks using the spaCy library. The notebook demonstrates the download and utilization of spaCy's large English model, `en_core_web_lg`, which is well-suited for tasks requiring an extensive understanding of the English language, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and other complex text processing operations.
